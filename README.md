Waiter Tips Prediction
This is a machine learning project that predicts the tips that a waiter will receive based on various features such as the total bill amount, table size, day of the week, time of day, and more.

To install this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. Then, you can clone the project from GitHub using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/waiter-tips-prediction.git
After cloning the project, you'll need to install the required Python packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project, you'll need to run the waiter_tips_prediction.py script. You can do this from the command line using the following command:

Copy code
python waiter_tips_prediction.py
This will train the machine learning model on the dataset provided in the tips.csv file and then use the model to make predictions on new data.

You can modify the input data by editing the input_data.csv file. This file should contain the same columns as the tips.csv file (except for the tip column, which is the target variable that we're trying to predict).

Results
The project will output the predicted tips for each row in the input_data.csv file, as well as some evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error and R-squared score.
