It belongs to a class of models that explains a given time series based on its own past values -i.e.- its own lags and the lagged forecast errors. The equation can be used to forecast future values. Any ‘non-seasonal’ time series that exhibits patterns and is not a random white noise can be modeled with ARIMA models.\n","\n","\n","- So, **ARIMA**, short for **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average**, is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the information in the past values of the time series can alone be used to predict the future values.\n","\n","\n","- **ARIMA Models** are specified by three order parameters: (p, d, q), \n","\n","   where,\n","\n","   - p is the order of the AR term\n","\n","   - q is the order of the MA term\n","\n","   - d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary\n","\n","\n","- **AR(p) Autoregression** – a regression model that utilizes the dependent relationship between a current observation and observations over a previous period.
